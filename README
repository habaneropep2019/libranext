This is the home of the Libranext distribution. You can find all files in the distribution here.

Please note, that at this time Libranext is a pure 64-bit system. Adding support for other architectures is planned in the
future, but the build system assumes a pure 64-bit system.

Using the integrated build system
==================================

Building Individual Packages
=============================
In each directory, you'll find a source tarball, all required patches, and a script called build.sh. Libranext is a
Debian clone, and while you'll find dpkg is present, and all software is packaged as .deb packages, some of the tooling
you'd normally find for handling Debian packages is not present (such as the debhelper tools, etc.). I'm certainly not
disputing the quality or handiness of these tools, however, this is a one-man project right now, and getting these tools
to work properly on a bare-bones Libranext system takes a lot more effort than it's worth, as some of the tools require
Debian-specific items (such as a Debian-patched Python3). It would be nice to eventually have these tools, but for now it's
not feasible. This at least provides some level of reproducible builds. All build.sh scripts are licensed under the MIT license,
as the commands are often used from Linux from Scratch, especially for packages included in base.

Essentially, you can simply run ./build.sh to compile the source code and create a Debian package. It's simple, and doesn't
have any way to check for build-time dependencies. Since Libranext is a Debian clone created largely from Linux from Scratch,
you'll find both the packages.debian.org website and Linux from Scratch documentation immensely useful.

Note that you may find multiple versions of source in each directory. build.sh will be updated to default to the newest version.
You can specify a different (aka older) version of each package by passing the full name of the source folder you wish to use.
