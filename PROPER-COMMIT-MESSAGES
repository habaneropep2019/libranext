In order to facilitate sensible Git commit messages, Libranext will typically
expect there to be a "tag" per se on the first line.

For example:

	RELEASE thispackage_1.0
	
	The detailed message goes here
	
Acceptable tags:

RELEASE - Used when committing a new release in a multiversion build package.
