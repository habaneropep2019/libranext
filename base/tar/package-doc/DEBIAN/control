Description: Documentation for the GNU version of the tar archiving utility
 Tar is a program for packaging a set of files as a single archive in tar format. The function it performs is conceptually similar to cpio, and to things like PKZIP in the DOS world. It is heavily used by the Debian package management system, and is useful for performing system backups and exchanging sets of files with others.
